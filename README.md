# Cybersecurity Projects

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Projects** collection!  
This folder contains hands-on projects focused on security automation, password protection, and cyber threat prevention.  
Each project demonstrates practical applications of cybersecurity concepts using programming and analysis techniques.

## Project List

### 1. [Password Strength Checker](password-strength-checker)
A Python tool that analyzes the strength of passwords based on character variety, length, and pattern detection.  
It encourages better password practices to defend against brute-force and dictionary attacks.

### 2. [Phishing Link Detector](phishing-link-detector)
A Python tool that analyzes URLs to detect potential phishing attempts.  
It checks for suspicious keywords, uncommon domains, and unsafe patterns through regular expressions and domain analysis.  

### 3. [Keylogger Detector](keylogger-detector)
(Coming soon)  
A planned project that will scan running system processes to identify potential keylogger activity and enhance user input security.
